ABOUT US PAGE
Our Story
Green Space Academy was founded to answer a simple but powerful question:
What if every young person in Africa had the knowledge, skills, and confidence to lead climate action?
Since 2021, we have worked alongside schools, communities, and partners to transform this vision into reality, empowering thousands of young Africans to build resilient communities, drive green innovation, and inspire change.
Our Vision: A continent where every young person is an environmental steward, innovator, and changemaker.
Our Mission
To bridge the gap between climate knowledge and action by equipping young Africans aged 8–35 with education, skills, and platforms for impact.
Our Values
Youth Leadership 
We put young people at the center, as decision-makers, innovators, and storytellers driving climate solutions in their communities.
Equity and Inclusion
We prioritize marginalized voices, dismantle barriers to participation, and ensure everyone has the opportunity to learn, lead, and thrive.
Collaboration and Community
We believe lasting impact happens when communities, partners, and young people co-create solutions rooted in trust, respect, and shared purpose.
Courage and Action
Climate change demands urgency and boldness. We encourage young people to speak up, challenge the status quo, and take action even when it’s uncomfortable or inconvenient.

Climate Advocacy and Leadership
Shifting Power. Amplifying Voices. Driving Change.
At Green Space Academy, we believe climate decisions should never be made without the voices of those most affected. Our Climate Advocacy and Leadership program equips young people, especially Global South and marginalized youth to step into spaces of power, challenge social norms about who is a leader, and drive policies that build a just, sustainable future.
We are breaking barriers that have long excluded young leaders from climate negotiations, media narratives, and decision-making spaces. Whether in a village council meeting or a UN climate summit, our advocates are shaping the conversation.
 What Does Advocacy Look Like at Green Space Academy?
We approach our advocacy work through four key thematic areas; leadership and policy influence, storytelling and narrative change, community mobilization and grassroots action, and Research and knowledge equity.
